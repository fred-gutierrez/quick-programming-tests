# Quick Programming Tests

Sup! This is a new project I'm making to help myself and others with some quick programming tests, either to quickly reinforce our knowledge or quickly practice before an interview.

## Tech stack

### Frontend:
- Angular
- Sass (SCSS)

### Backend:
- MongoDB
  - with Mongoose
- Cors
- Nodejs
- Express

## Reminders
- `app.routes.ts` is the place to add any new pages/paths.
- `ng generate component name` after 'generate' we must specify the schematic, in which for an actual component, we must specify as generate is used for many other things.
